## Contributing to fzf-make
Contributions are welcome!

Submitting PRs isn't the only way to contribute! Requesting features or participating in discussions through issues and discussions are also valuable contributions.

Please read below guidelines before writing code.

## Before Contributing
Please check the issues first before you submit a PR. If the issue you want to work on is already being assigned to someone else, please contact if you want to work on it.

## Guidelines for AI-Assisted Contributions
1. Using AI for PR creation is perfectly fine.
1. We welcome PRs from developers who are not proficient in Rust. In fact, I([@kyu08](https://github.com/kyu08)) myself am just a casual Rust enthusiast. ðŸ˜‚
1. **Please ensure you understand what your code does before submitting a PR.**
    - AI-generated code that hasn't been reviewed by humans tends to place a heavy burden on reviewers.
1. **When maintainers ask questions, please avoid responding like "I don't know, but this is how the AI generated it." Please understand the code content and discuss it in your own words.**
