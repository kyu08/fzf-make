## Guildlines for AI-Assisted Contributions
1. Using AI for PR creation is perfectly fine.
1. We welcome PRs from developers who are not proficient in Rust. In fact, I([@kyu08](https://github.com/kyu08)) myself am just a casual Rust enthusiast. ðŸ˜‚
1. **Please ensure you understand what your code does before submitting a PR.**
    - AI-generated code that hasn't been reviewed by humans tends to place a heavy burden on reviewers.
    - If you find it difficult to understand AI-generated code, we welcome discussions about the problem you want to solve in an issue/discussions before creating a PR.
1. When maintainers ask questions, please avoid responding like "I don't know, but this is how the AI generated it." Please understand the code content and discuss it in your own words.
